## 1.1 Introduction to HCI



*   Human-computer interaction can take different forms:
    *   Human interacts with computer (and vice-versa)
    *   Human interacts with a task through a computer (computer mediates the interaction) => the human + computer interact with the task together
       *   Ideally, we focus on making the interface of the computer/program as invisible as possible, so the human can focus on the task they’re trying to accomplish
        *   The goal is to let the user spend as much time thinking about the task rather than thinking about the interface
    *   Video games: the controller behaves as you expect it to, becoming invisible as you try to accomplish your in-game mission
    *   Having more than one remote control: you need to spend time looking at the remote, determining which one is best for the task, if you need to use multiple controls, etc
*   HCI is ubiquitous - it’s everywhere!
    *   We might be experts at interacting with computers, but that doesn’t make us experts at designing interactions between other humans and computers.
*   HCI is a subset of the broader field of **human factors engineering **
    *   **Human factors engineering**: designing the interactions between people and products, systems, or devices
       *   We’re interested in designing the interactions between people and computers, but computers are themselves products or systems.
        *   Human factors is interested in the non-computing parts of this as well
        *   As computers integrate themselves into more and more of our devices, the gap between human-computer interaction and human factors engineering is shrinking.
        *   Can be seen as the merging of engineering + psychology + design + cognitive science fields
        *   Psychology is a symbiotic field with HCI — psychology informs HCI, and we use our experiences and feedback in HCI to add to the field of psychology
    *   HCI is largely about understanding the interactions between humans and computers.
    *   UX design is largely about designing, or dictating, those interactions.
    *   We use what we understand about humans to design user experiences, then we use the results of these user experiences to examine whether our understanding was correct.
    *   Called **design-based research**: using the results of our designs to conduct research => research informs the design, and feedback from the designs informs/updates/adds to our research

## 1.2 Exploring HCI



*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Virtual reality (VR)**: generally works by replacing the real world’s visual, auditory, and sometimes even olfactory or kinesthetic stimuli with its own input.
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Augmented reality (AR)**: complements what you see and hear in the real world.
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Human-robot interaction** is going to become more mainstream over the next few decades
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Mobile** is growing rapidly
    *   Mobile computing is deeply related to fields like context-aware computing, ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality as it possesses the hardware necessary to complement all these efforts.
*   **Context** is a fundamental part of the way humans interact with other humans.
    *   **[IDEA] Context-sensitive computing**: equipping user interfaces with historical, geographical, or other forms of contextual knowledge. Attempts to give computer interfaces the contextual knowledge that humans have in their everyday interactions
    *   There’s an enormous amount of research to be done on context-sensitive computing, especially as it relates to wearables, augmented reality, and ubiquitous computing
    *   **[IDEA] Gesture-based interaction**: computers interpret our gestures. Gesture-based interaction has enormous potential. The fingers have some of the finest muscle movements, meaning that a system based on finger movements could support an incredible number of interactions
*   **[IDEA] Pen-based and touch-based interaction**
    *   Tablet-based interaction methods have been used even in fields like art and music
*   **[IDEA] Information visualization**: representing abstract data visually to help humans understand it
    *   The goal of information visualization is to match the reader’s mental model of the phenomenon to the reality of it
*   **[IDEA] Computer-supported cooperative work**: how can we use computers to support people working together?
    *   The CSCW community often breaks things down into two dimensions: time and place
    *   We can think of design as whether we’re designing for users in the same time and place or at different times and in different places
    * ![screenshot](/images_Exam1/image3.png)
    *   Think of CSCW as mediating cooperation across traditional geographical and temporal borders, but it can also help with colocated simultaneous cooperation
    *   **Examples**: museum asking visitors for their location (same place, different times) / Dr. Joyner recording a video and us watching it (diff place, diff time) / Slack (diff place, same time)
*   **[IDEA] Social computing**: how computers affect the way we interact and socialize
    *   **Examples**: emojis, social media, Wikipedia, online gaming, dating websites
*   **[DOMAIN] Special needs applications**: computing can help us compensate for disabilities, injuries, and aging
    *   **Examples**: VR for paralyzed people, AI for autonomous wheelchairs, robotic prosthetic
    *   Impact is super high
*   **[DOMAIN] Education**
    *   Education technology is highly based on HCI principles
    *   You might use HCI to create desirable difficulties as learning experiences for students
*   **[DOMAIN] Healthcare**
    *   **Examples**: info visualization for making changes to your lifestyle, context-aware computing to detect when you’re about to do something unhealthy, FitBit for fitness tracking, MyFitnessPal for diet tracking, VR for therapy
*   **[DOMAIN] Security**
    *   The most secure communication strategies in the world are weakened if people refuse to use them
    *   And historically, people have very little patience for instances when security measures get in the way of doing a task.
    *   _For security to be useful, it has to be usable_ -- if it isn’t usable, people just won’t use it.
    *   **Examples**: make actions easier to perform, showing password requirements as met or unmet, password requirements as a game
*   **[DOMAIN] Video gaming**
    *   The actions the user takes with the controller should feel like they’re actually interacting within the game world
    *   Video games are a near-constant feedback cycle as the user takes actions, evaluates the results, and adjusts accordingly.
    *   Poor interface design can frustrate users, causing the game to be reviewed as poor

 ## 1.3 The future of human-computer interactions in smart and interconnected environments
 
 
* In this era of rapidly advancing technology, the future of living and functional environments would involve humans interacting, coordinating, and collaborating with computers, machines, robots, and various technology-laden systems in a multitude of ways. Examples of such smart and interconnected environments include Smart Homes, Smart Industries, Smart Workplaces, Smart Buildings, and Smart Cities, just to name a few. These two books present discoveries, innovative ideas, concepts, theoretical findings, practical solutions, improvements, and novel applications in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aimed at developing trust, user acceptance, enhancing user performance, improving quality of life, and fostering human-technology partnerships in the future of technology-laden living and functional environments.

* This book, Part 1 of this 2-part book set, consists of chapters that present approaches for facilitating rich user experiences in multiple healthcare-based applications, results from digital product usability tests conducted with children having atypical development, results from usability testing of Twitter, applications of HCI in healthcare for diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, approaches to highlight the role of end-user programmers in custom graphical user interface designs for the future of HCI-enhancing devices and a specific application of optimization techniques in artificial neural networks with a human-in-the-loop focus. This book also presents two review chapters related to assistive technologies for the visually impaired and gamified online learning user experience. Each chapter has an abstract and keywords followed by the introduction, methodologies, and other sections. Readers can determine their interest level in any chapter quickly based on the keywords and the abstract. The chapters in this book were contributed by experts in the field of HCI and its interrelated disciplines from 8 different countries – Chile, China, Croatia, India, Iran, Malaysia, Peru, and South Korea.

* Human-Computer Interaction and Beyond: Advances Towards Smart and Interconnected Environments is an informative reference for scientists, researchers, and developers in both academia and industry who wish to learn, design, implement, and apply these emerging technologies in HCI in different sectors, with the goal of realizing futuristic technology-driven living and functional smart cities and environments.
