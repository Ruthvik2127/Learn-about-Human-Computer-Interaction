## 1.1 Introduction to HCI

* HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings.As its name implies, HCI consists of three parts: the user, the computer itself, and the ways they work together.

* User
By "user", we may mean an individual user, a group of users working together. An appreciation of the way people's sensory systems (sight, hearing, touch) relay information is vital. Also, different users form different conceptions or mental models about their interactions and have different ways of learning and keeping knowledge and. In      addition, cultural and national differences play a part.

* Computer
When we talk about the computer, we're referring to any technology ranging from desktop computers, to large scale computer systems. For example, if we were discussing the design of a Website, then the Website itself would be referred to as "the computer". Devices such as mobile phones or VCRs can also be considered to be “computers”.

* Interaction
There are obvious differences between humans and machines. In spite of these, HCI attempts to ensure that they both get on with each other and interact successfully. In order to achieve a usable system, you need to apply what you know about humans and computers, and consult with likely users throughout the design process. In real systems, the schedule and the budget are important, and it is vital to find a balance between what would be ideal for the users and what is feasible in reality.

## 1.2 Factors in HCI
There are a large number of factors which should be considered in the analysis and design of a system using HCI principles. Many of these factors interact with each other, making the analysis even more complex. The main factors are listed in the table below:
* Organisation Factors
  Training, job design, politics, roles, workorganisation
* Environmental Factors
  Noise, heating, lighting, ventilation
  Health and Safety Factors
* The User
  Cognitive processes and capabilities
  Motivation, enjoyment, satisfaction, personality, experience
* Comfort Factors
  Seating, equipment, layout.
* User Interface
   Input devices, output devices, dialogue structures, use of colour, icons, commands, navigation, graphics, natural language, user support, multimedia,
* Task Factors
   Easy, complex, novel, task allocation, monitoring, skills
* Constraints
   Cost, timescales, budgets, staff, equipment, buildings
* System Functionality
   Hardware, software, application
* Productivity Factors
   Increase output, increase quality, decrease costs, decrease errors, increase innovation

## 1.3 Exploring HCI


*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Virtual reality (VR)**: generally works by replacing the real world’s visual, auditory, and sometimes even olfactory or kinesthetic stimuli with its own input.
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Augmented reality (AR)**: complements what you see and hear in the real world.
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Human-robot interaction** is going to become more mainstream over the next few decades
*   **[TECHNOLOGY] Mobile** is growing rapidly
    *   Mobile computing is deeply related to fields like context-aware computing, ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality as it possesses the hardware necessary to complement all these efforts.
*   **Context** is a fundamental part of the way humans interact with other humans.
    *   **[IDEA] Context-sensitive computing**: equipping user interfaces with historical, geographical, or other forms of contextual knowledge. Attempts to give computer interfaces the contextual knowledge that humans have in their everyday interactions
    *   There’s an enormous amount of research to be done on context-sensitive computing, especially as it relates to wearables, augmented reality, and ubiquitous computing
    *   **[IDEA] Gesture-based interaction**: computers interpret our gestures. Gesture-based interaction has enormous potential. The fingers have some of the finest muscle movements, meaning that a system based on finger movements could support an incredible number of interactions
*   **[IDEA] Pen-based and touch-based interaction**
    *   Tablet-based interaction methods have been used even in fields like art and music
*   **[IDEA] Information visualization**: representing abstract data visually to help humans understand it
    *   The goal of information visualization is to match the reader’s mental model of the phenomenon to the reality of it
*   **[IDEA] Computer-supported cooperative work**: how can we use computers to support people working together?
    *   The CSCW community often breaks things down into two dimensions: time and place
    *   We can think of design as whether we’re designing for users in the same time and place or at different times and in different places
    * ![screenshot](/images_Exam1/image3.png)
    *   Think of CSCW as mediating cooperation across traditional geographical and temporal borders, but it can also help with colocated simultaneous cooperation
    *   **Examples**: museum asking visitors for their location (same place, different times) / Dr. Joyner recording a video and us watching it (diff place, diff time) / Slack (diff place, same time)
*   **[IDEA] Social computing**: how computers affect the way we interact and socialize
    *   **Examples**: emojis, social media, Wikipedia, online gaming, dating websites
*   **[DOMAIN] Special needs applications**: computing can help us compensate for disabilities, injuries, and aging
    *   **Examples**: VR for paralyzed people, AI for autonomous wheelchairs, robotic prosthetic
    *   Impact is super high
*   **[DOMAIN] Education**
    *   Education technology is highly based on HCI principles
    *   You might use HCI to create desirable difficulties as learning experiences for students
*   **[DOMAIN] Healthcare**
    *   **Examples**: info visualization for making changes to your lifestyle, context-aware computing to detect when you’re about to do something unhealthy, FitBit for fitness tracking, MyFitnessPal for diet tracking, VR for therapy
*   **[DOMAIN] Security**
    *   The most secure communication strategies in the world are weakened if people refuse to use them
    *   And historically, people have very little patience for instances when security measures get in the way of doing a task.
    *   _For security to be useful, it has to be usable_ -- if it isn’t usable, people just won’t use it.
    *   **Examples**: make actions easier to perform, showing password requirements as met or unmet, password requirements as a game
*   **[DOMAIN] Video gaming**
    *   The actions the user takes with the controller should feel like they’re actually interacting within the game world
    *   Video games are a near-constant feedback cycle as the user takes actions, evaluates the results, and adjusts accordingly.
    *   Poor interface design can frustrate users, causing the game to be reviewed as poor

 ## 1.5 A Better Future – A Better World
 
 
* There’s one thing that remains certain – new forms of HCI will change our lives significantly. They will, undoubtedly, offer the chance to improve the quality of life of people who can’t take advantage of current interfaces due to physical disabilities. But then again, it comes with a hitch. New issues will arise such as the ones related to privacy, security, and ethics, thus potentially slowing the diffusion of new hardware and software.

* What is amazing about human computer interaction is that just as the mouse and the keyboard were innovations, and the iPhone was a better innovation, the Kinect is also an innovation in response to input technology. But all these are just stepping stones towards less physical interfaces.

* The opportunities for HCI are tremendous. Progress toward more user-friendly and natural interfaces for human-machine interaction can yield a plethora of advantages and can majorly impact everyday life.
